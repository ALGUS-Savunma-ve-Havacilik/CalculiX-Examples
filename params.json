{"name":"Calculix-examples","tagline":"Example CalculiX FEA models","body":"### Why CalculiX Examples\r\nCalculiX is an open source finite element analysis program. It comes as a pair of two programs: The solver CalculiX CrunchiX (CCX) by Guido Dhondt and the pre- and postprocessor CalculiX GraphiX (CGX) by Klaus Wittig. \r\n\r\nIt has an input file format similar to ABAQUS. The program covers various analysis types in various levels of verification and stability. It comes with a large set of examples, mainly meant for verification (there are reference result files for comparison), but also a helpful reference when approaching new features. \r\n\r\nThese examples don't include pre- and postprocessing, they just provide a static mesh and the solver input. The examples in the present project are meant to demonstrate parametric workflows based on CGX parametrization features and on Python scripts.\r\n\r\nThis site is work in progress ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
