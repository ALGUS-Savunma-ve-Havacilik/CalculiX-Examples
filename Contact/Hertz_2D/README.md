# Hertz Contact 2D
Tested with CGX/CCX 2.9

+ Plane strain model
+ Linear elasticity
+ Surface-to-surface Penalty contact

The model was inspired by  [this post](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/calculix/conversations/topics/11564) by user dichtstoff in the CalculiX user forum. Here, essentially, parametrization with the CGX `valu` command and mesh bias were added.

## Preprocessing
Two separate parts are generated and meshed with plane strain elements.
```
> cgx -b pre.fbd
```

## Solving
```
> ccx Hertz
> ../../Scripts/monitor.py Hertz
```
Currently, `monitor.py` fails to produce the convergence plot due to a bug. There is convergence with just 10 iterations in a single increment.

## Postprocessing

```
> cgx -b post.frd
```
The solution shows the expected feature of Hertz contact with the maximum of the equivalent stress somewhat below the contact surface.
