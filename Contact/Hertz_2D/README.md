# Hertz Contact 2D
Tested with CGX/CCX 2.10

+ Plane strain model
+ Linear elasticity
+ Surface-to-surface Penalty contact

The model was inspired by  [this post](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/calculix/conversations/topics/11564) by user dichtstoff in the CalculiX user forum. Here, essentially, parametrization with the CGX `valu` command and mesh bias were added.

## Preprocessing
Two separate parts are generated and meshed with plane strain elements.
```
> cgx -b pre.fbd
```

## Solving

## Postprocessing

```
> cgx -b post.fbd
```
The solution shows the expected feature of Hertz contact with the maximum of the equivalent stress somewhat below the contact surface.
