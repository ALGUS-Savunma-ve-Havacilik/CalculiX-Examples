| [equ.inp](equ.inp)     | CCX input, MPC contact with `*equation`       |

The only reliable contact version to connect face to edge of shell elements seems to be MPC contact with `*tie`.

MPC contact with `*equation` leads to a hinged connection at shell edge to face contact (7 rigid body modes).

Surface-to-surface penalty contact does not at all connect the parts.

Node-to-surface penalty contact throws an error:
```
*ERROR in springforc: no overclosure model
        selected. This is mandatory in a penalty
        contact calculation. Please use the
        *SURFACE BEHAVIOR card.
```

## Preprocessing
Two separate parts are generated and meshed with shell elements.
```
> cgx -b pre.fbd
```

## Solving
Use the appropriate input file  for the contact version you want to test:
```
> ccx tie
```

## Postprocessing

Load the results file in CGX
```
> cgx tie.frd
```
Display animated mode shapes coloured with the displacement magnitude. Show the elements and increase the default scaling of the mode shapes.
```
view elem
scal d 2
ds 1 a 4
```
Browse through the individual mode shapes using the PageDown and PageUp keys.
