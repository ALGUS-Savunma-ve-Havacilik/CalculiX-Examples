MPC contact with  `*tie` and penalty contact lead to a stiff connection betwenn shell edge to shell face. Node-to-surface penalty contact and MPC contact with `*tie` show similar behaviour. The frequencies for penalty contact are usually slightly lower than with MPC contact, which is plausible, as the penalty contact has added compliance.

Surface-to-surface contact gives frequencies which differ severely from the reference MPC contact. Also, for S8R elements, there are only 5 frequencies close to zero (should be 6 rigid body modes).

Penalty contact (both surface-to-surface and node-to-surface) requires the modal analysis being performed as a perturbation step with a preceeding static step (in the given case with no load applied). Note that the first result increment in a perturbation analysis is not a mode shape.

MPC contact with `*equation` leads to a hinged connection at shell edge to face contact (7 rigid body modes).

## Solving
Use the appropriate input file  for the contact version you want to test:
```
> ccx tie
```

## Postprocessing

Load the results file in CGX
```
> cgx tie.frd
```
Display animated mode shapes coloured with the displacement magnitude. Show the elements and increase the default scaling of the mode shapes.
```
view elem
scal d 2
ds 1 a 4
```
Browse through the individual mode shapes using the PageDown and PageUp keys.
