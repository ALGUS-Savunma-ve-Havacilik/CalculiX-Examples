The model represents a four point bending test on an elasto-plastic aluminium honeycomb sandwich plate. The honeycombs are of expanded type, i.e. 1/3 of the walls has double thickness.

Parameter | Description
:---      | :-----
`le`      | Length of double-thickness walls
`wb`      | Cell width in expansion direction
`hw`      | Heigth of the core
`lx`      | Half sample target length
`ly`      | Half sample target width
`x1`      | Distance from center to upper cylinder (indenter)
`x2`      | Distance from center to lower cylinder (support)
`radius`  | Radius of the cylinders
`tupper`  | Thickness of the upper face sheet
`tlower`  | Thickness of the lower face sheet
`tsingle` | Thickness of the core material
`divx`    | Division of the (half) walls in x direction
`divy`    | Division of the angled walls in y direction
`divz`    | Division of the walls in z direction

## Pre-Processing

You may edit the file [par.pre.fbl](par.pre.fbl) and then run
```
> param.py par.pre.fbl
> cgx -b pre.fbl
```
First, a unit cell is generated and then copied in x- and y-direction as many
times as is required to fit the target dimensions.

Then, all elements off the target are are cut away.

The cylinders for load application and support are completely displacement controlled, they have
no degrees of freedom.

Shell elements expanded to a single layer of volume elements are not really appropriate for plastic deformations, because they have just two cross thickness integration points.

## Solving
The rate of convergence is affected by the plastic material, the mesh density, the contact stiffness and the time incrementation controls.
