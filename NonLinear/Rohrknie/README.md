## Shell Model, Modal Analysis

In order to avoid inconsistent use of the individual scripts, top level script files are provided, which contain the calls to pre-processing, solving and post-processing.
```
> cgx -b shell-modal.fbd
```

## Solid Model, Static Analysis

In the static analysis we apply a distributed load to the upper end of the tube. The generation of a force-displacement curve is demonstrated.

First, the mesh is generated:
```
> cgx -b solid.fbd
```
### Solution
The analysis consists of two steps.
 1. Full load is applied in negative x-direction, just the final results are written to the results files.
 2. The load is increased until it reaches the same value in positive x-direction. The results are written in small intervals for generation of a force-displacement curve
```
> ccx solid-static
> ../../Scripts/monitor.py solid-static
```

### Postprocessing:
```
> cgx -b post-solid-static.fbd
```
Steps for generation of the  force-displacement curve:
 1. Extraction of the time history data from the dat-file using the script [dat2txt.py](../../Scripts/dat2txt.py).
 2. Creating a single file from the displacement history and the force history using the `join` shell command.
 3. Running Gnuplot with the command file [df.gpl](df.gpl).

The force-displacement plot is heavily non-linear because of the severe changes of the section moment of inertia due to ovalization.
