The model represents an overlap laser weld with a fault (interruption, gap). Such gaps can't be found by visual inspection, as they look like perfect welds from both sides.

A method to detect such faults is thermographic testing with heat impulse excitation (e.g. by induction, by pressurized air or by flash light).

## Pre-Processing
The geometry consists of four bricks which are independently meshed.

You may edit the file [values.fbl](values.fbl) and then run
```
> cgx -b pre.fbl
```
Thermal contact is established via equations, which essentialy establish tied contact. The equations are generated by CGX using lines of the type

## Solving

In order to avoid inconsistent use of the individual scripts, top level script files are provided, which contain the calls to pre-processing, solving and post-processing.
