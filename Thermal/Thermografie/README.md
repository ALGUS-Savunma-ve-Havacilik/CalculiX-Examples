The model represents an overlap laser weld with a fault (interruption, gap). Such gaps can't be found by visual inspection, as they look like perfect welds from both sides.

A method to detect such faults is thermographic testing with heat impulse excitation (e.g. by induction, by pressurized air or by flash light).

## Pre-Processing
The geometry consists of four bricks which are independently meshed.

You may edit the file [values.fbl](values.fbl) and then run
```
> cgx -b pre.fbl
```
Thermal contact is established via equations, which essentialy establish tied contact. The equations are generated by CGX using lines of the type
```

```
## Solving

In order to avoid inconsistent use of the individual scripts, top level script files are provided, which contain the calls to pre-processing, solving and post-processing.

## Post-Processing

```
> cgx -b post.fbl
```

A time history plot of the temperature at four probe locations is generated:
```
> cgx -b plots.fbl
```
The probes are located at the center of the first seam segment and of the fault (gap), on the top (excitation) and on the bottom side. These locations are computed from the geometric parameters of the model.
